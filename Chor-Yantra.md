Project Chor-Yantra.                                        
The first project of the task one is to make a anti-theft system using a combination of sensors.             
I thought of this by first i wanted to include motion sesnor alarm and a tilt sensor and the ideaa was to make it such that it rings when motion is detected and/or when the platform is tilted 
Then i decided to increase its complexity by adding a temperature sensor in case there is an attempt to burn the platform
Morever i included flex sensor so that it the case is compressed or played with the sensor activates
But theres a catch i considered making it most power effecient so it wont be operating continuously it would act only when there is tampering in motion sensor and then it activates all other sesnor for exact 
activity to be found and corresponding measures to imply .
then i included 3 more pir motion detectors one for each direction.

tilt sensor was not being effective i replaced it with force sensor
